- Modify plates of installed AC (Assetto Corsa) vehicles. (install custom plates or reset to default)
- Select one or more cars/tracks and export as .zip file which you can export directly from ACSPI or upload it on your own
- Manage cars/tracks. (delete, install from packs)
- Once you upload files using ACSPI to [anonfiles](https://anonfiles.com/), you can view all uploaded files within the app.

# First run and basic information
- ACSPInstaller is NOT an installer, that's just the name of the app (Assetto Corsa Server Pack Installer)
- You can put ACSPI anywhere, in settings you can create a desktop shortcut
- When first run you must set the assetto corsa folder, to do so, go to settings and click Set AC folder or you can try Auto Set if your AC is installed in the default steam location in C drive
- The first idea of the project was to make packs for servers for easier installation, but changed the idea to allow users to upload/download packs

- Packs are saved in "C:\ACSP\archives\packs"

# Faster downloads with anonfiles
I recommend using a download manager to download ACSPI Packs with higher speeds (>1MB/s)

## Why anonfiles?
Because it was the only free website with free file uploading and a compatible API. If you know any other (faster) site please let me know.
