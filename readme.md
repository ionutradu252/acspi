# Faster downloads with anonfiles
I recommend using a download manager to download ACSPI Packs with higher speeds (>1MB/s)

## Why anonfiles?
Because it was the only free website with free file uploading and a compatible API. If you know any other (faster) site please let me know.

Try [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/) (not sponsored, this is what I use)
